# Stock-Prices-Prediction-and-Forecasting
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory networks[LSTM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning-introduction-to-long-short-term-memory/), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. By utilizing historical stock price data, the model generates predictions for future stock prices, providing insights for investors and analysts.

# Features
Collects historical stock price data from Tiingo API.Preprocesses the data using MinMaxScaler for normalization.Implements an LSTM model for time series forecasting.Visualizes predictions against actual prices.Exports predictions to CSV for further analysis.
