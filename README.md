# Stock-Prices-Prediction-and-Forecasting
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory networks [(LSTM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning-introduction-to-long-short-term-memory/), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. By utilizing historical stock price data, the model generates predictions for future stock prices, providing insights for investors and analysts.

# Features
Collects historical stock price data from [Tiingo API](https://www.tiingo.com/documentation/general/overview).Preprocesses the data using MinMaxScaler for normalization.Implements an LSTM model for time series forecasting.Visualizes predictions against actual prices.Exports predictions to CSV for further analysis.

# Libraries employed
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Keras
TensorFlow
